# FitCrÃ¼ Fitness App ðŸ’ª

Welcome to FitCrÃ¼, a fitness app designed and developed as a demo/portfolio project using Flutter and Firebase. This application showcases a range of skills acquired during its creation, including mobile app development, database integration, and user interface design.

FitCrÃ¼ was intended to be used with a sibling app that is used by one's 'trainer'. The trainer's role is to set the exercises and nutritional plans. The app you're looking at is the client app that consumes this data, and allows the user to add information to track their progress, such as: a weight tracker, progress pictures, and intra-session data.
